  <li>understand the architecture of <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> and train
gain experience with training these models on data</li>

<h3 id="q4-convnet-on-cifar-10-30-points">Q4: ConvNet on CIFAR-10 (30 points)</h3>
<p>In the Jupyter Notebook <code class="highlighter-rouge">ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb</code> you will implement several
new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks. You will train a
(shallow) convolutional network on CIFAR-10, and it will then be up to you to
train the best network that you can.</p>
