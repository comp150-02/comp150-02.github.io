  <p>In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code and training Convolutional
Neural Networks. The goal of this assignment
is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the architecture of <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> and train
gain experience with training these models on data</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Get the starter code by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/comp150DL/hw3.git">hw3 github repository</a>. 
This can be accomplished by executing the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash
highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight">
<code><span class="nb">git clone </span>https://github.com/comp150DL/hw3.git
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Setup Virtualenv:</strong> If you have not created a virtualenv
for handling the python dependencies related to this course, please follow the 
<a href="/notes/virtualenv-tutorial/">Virtualenv tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to work on the provided AWS instances, please
follow the
<a href="/notes/tufts-aws-tutorial/">Tufts AWS tutorial</a> for how to
connect to your Jupyter Notebook remotely.</p>

<p>To satisfy all software dependencies, start your virtualenv and
double check that all required packages are installed:</p>

<div class="language-bash
highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight">
<code><span class="nb">workon </span>deep-venv
<span class="nb">cd </span> hw3
<span class="nb">pip install -r </span>requirements.txt
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Download data:</strong> Once you have the starter code, you
will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.  Run the following from
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw3</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash
highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>datasets
./get_datasets.sh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Start Jupyter Notebook:</strong> After you have the
CIFAR-10 data, you should start the Jupyter Notebook server from the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hw3</code> directory. If you
are unfamiliar with Jupyter, you should read the
<a href="https://compsci697l.github.io/notes/jupyter-tutorial/">Jupyter tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-your-work">Submitting your work</h3>

<p>To make sure everything is working properly, <strong>remember to do
a clean run (“Kernel -&gt; Restart &amp; Run All”) after you finish
work for each notebook</strong> and submit the final version with all
the outputs.  Once you are done working, compress all the code and
notebooks in a single file and submit your archive by emailing to comp150dl@gmail.com.
On Linux or macOS
you can run the
provided <code class="highlighter-rouge">collectSubmission.sh</code>
script from <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw3/</code> to
produce a
file <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw3.zip</code> (or 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hw3.tar.gz</code> if zip is not on your system) .</p>



<h3 id="q1-convnet-on-cifar-10-30-points">Q1: ConvNet on CIFAR-10 (90 points)</h3>
<p>In the Jupyter Notebook <code class="highlighter-rouge">ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb</code> you will implement several
new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks. You will train a
(shallow) convolutional network on CIFAR-10, and it will then be up to you to
train the best network that you can.</p>

<h3 id="q2-do-something-extra-up-to-10-points">Q2: Do something extra! (10 points)</h3>
<p>In the process of training your CNN, you should feel free to implement
anything that you want to get better performance. You can modify the solver,
implement additional layers, use different types of regularization, use an
ensemble of models, or anything else that comes to mind.</p>
