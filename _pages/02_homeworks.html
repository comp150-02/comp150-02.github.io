<h4>Late Submission Policy</h4>
<p>
Homework assignments maybe submitted after the announced deadline for
 a deduction of 10% of the total score achieved per late day up to 5 days. 
After 5 days, the homework will no longer be accepted for a grade
unless the student can provide an administrative or medical excuse.
</p>
<p> 
Reading summaries, paper presentations, and any deadlines for the
final project will not be accepted after the posted deadlines.
</p>


<h4>Collaboration Policy</h4>
<p>
Programming is a creative process. Individuals must reach their own understanding of problems and
discover paths to their solutions. During this time, discussions with friends and colleagues are
encouragedâ€”you will do much better in the course, and at Tufts, if you find people with whom you
regularly discuss problems. But those discussions should take place in English, not in code. If you start
communicating in code, you're breaking the rules.
</p>
<p>
When you reach the coding stage, therefore, group discussions are no longer appropriate. Each
program, unless explicitly assigned as a pair or group problem, must be entirely your own work.
</p>
<p>
Pair and group assignments will be graded in large part on novelty, so
copying from another group or third-party code base won't help you
anyway. 
</p>

<h4>Note on cheating</h4> 
<p>
The homeworks have appeared with some alterations in other
courses. Student answers to the homeworks may be available
online. These answers <strong>may be wrong</strong>, or at least
confusing. Assignments build on each other, so it is important to
write and understand your own code. Submitted assignments will all be
run through Tufts' plagiarism detection software.<strong>You are
warned.</strong>
