<h2>Course Description</h2>

Entry</a></small> 
<br>
<p>
This course provides a practical foundation for deep learning, with a
special emphasis on those methods used in computer vision. The first
part of the class will introduce students to simple neural networks,
convolutional neural networks, and some elements of recurrent neural
networks, such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). Students
will implement, train, and test their own end-to-end models for image
classification. This course will cover the algorithmic fundamentals of
deep learning (backpropagation, optimization, etc.) as well as
engineering heuristics for getting networks to perform well.
</p>
<p> The second part of the course investigates current research topics
in deeplearning and object detection. These topics will be pursued
through independent reading, class discussion and presentations, and
and a final project that relates to current research problems in
computer vision.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this course is to give students the background and skills
necessary to perform research in deep learning and computer
vision. Students should understand the strengths and weaknesses of
current approaches to research problems and identify interesting open
questions and future research directions. Students will hopefully
improve their critical reading and communication skills, as well.

<h2>Course Requirements</h2>
<h3>Coding Assignments</h3>


<h3>Reading and Summaries</h3>
<p> 
Students will be expected to read 10-11
papers from the deep learning literature. These papers will be
presented in class by other students, and all student audience members
are expected to be prepared for discussion. For each assigned paper,
students must write a two or three sentence summary and identify at
least one question or topic of interest for class
discussion. Interesting topics for discussion could relate to
strengths and weaknesses of the paper, possible future directions,
connections to other research, uncertainty about the conclusions of
the experiments, etc. Reading summaries must be posted to
the <a href="http://comp150-02.blogspot.com/">class blog</a> by <b>11:59pm
the day before each class</b>. Feel free to reply to other comments on the
blog and help each other understanding confusing aspects of the
papers. The blog discussion will be the starting point for the class
discussion. If you are presenting you don't need to post a summary to
the blog.
</p>

<h3>Presentations</h3> 
<p>
Depending on enrollment, students will lead
the discussion of one or two papers during the semester. Ideally,
students would implement some aspect of the presented material and
perform experiments that help understand the algorithms. Presentations
and all supplemental material should be ready one week before the
presentation date so that students can meet with the instructor, go
over the presentation, and possibly iterate before the in-class
discussion. For the presentations it is fine to use slides and code
from outside sources (for example, the paper authors) but be sure to
give credit.
</p>

<h3>Semester projects</h3> 
<p>
Students are expected to complete a
state-of-the-art research project on topics relevant to the
course. Students will propose a research topic part way through the
semester. After a project topic is finalized, students will meet
occasionally with the instructor to discuss progress. Students will
present their progress on their semester project twice during the
course and the course will end with final project
presentations. Students will also produce a conference-formatted
write-up of their project. Projects will be published on the this web
page. The ideal project is something with a clear enough direction to
be completed in a couple of months, and enough novelty such that it
could be published in a peer-reviewed venue with some refinement and
extension.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2> 
<p>
Strong mathematical skills (linear algebra,
calculus, probability and statistics) and previous imaging (graphics,
vision, or computational photography) courses are needed.  It is
strongly recommended that students have taken one of the following
courses (or equivalent courses at other institutions):
</p>

<ul id="prereqs">
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1230.html">CSCI 1230, Introduction to Computer Graphics</a>
  </li><li><a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1950-g/">CSCI 1290, Computational 
Photography</a>

</li></ul>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
We will not rely on a textbook, although the free, online textbook <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/szeliski/Book/">"Computer 
Vision: Algorithms and Applications"</a> by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/szeliski/">Richard Szeliski</a> is a 
helpful resource.

<h2>Grading</h2>
Your final grade will be made up from
<ul id="grades">
  <li>20% Reading summaries posted to <a href="http://csci2951t.blogspot.com/">class blog</a></li>
  <li>20% Classroom participation and attendance, including completion of coding tutorials and project progress reports</li>
